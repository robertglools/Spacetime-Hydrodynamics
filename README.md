# Spacetime-Hydrodynamics
Spacetime Hydrodynamics (V4.0). Introduces the universal constant $v_{\text{rel}}=49.6 \, \text{km/s}$ and SQM non-linear coupling. Quantitatively unifies the angular momentum evolution of all main-sequence stars (K/G/F-type) and successfully resolves the F-Star Break anomaly in astrophysics.
